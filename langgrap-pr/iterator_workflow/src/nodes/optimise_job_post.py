    2. Increase engagement by using a professional yet friendly tone.
    3. Ensure the inclusion of relevant emojis and hashtags to make it more appealing.
    4. Strengthen the Call-to-Action (CTA) to inspire potential candidates to apply.

    âœ¨ Writing Style:
    - Keep it **professional yet friendly**.  
    - Use **emojis** where appropriate to make it engaging.  
    - Add **relevant hashtags** (e.g., #Hiring #JobOpportunity #CareerGrowth).  
    - Ensure it's easy to read, scannable, and appealing to top candidates.  
    - Ensure the job post does not exceed 300 words.
    - Ensure it includes all required sections (Job Title, Company Introduction, Role Overview, Key Responsibilities, Required Qualifications & Skills, Preferred Qualifications, Perks & Benefits, Call-to-Action).
    - Ensure it doesnot sound ai-generated and have human touch.

    *** You need to be very strict and critical while optimising the job post. Even if there is a minor issue, a minor feedback you must improve it. ***

    Return the output as a polished job post, ready to share on LinkedIn or social media.
